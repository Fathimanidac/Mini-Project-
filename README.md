"120 Years of Olympic History Athlete and Results"


This project analyzes 120 years of Olympic Games data, covering athlete demographics, event results, and participation trends. The dataset underwent thorough cleaning in Excel, including removal of duplicates, handling of missing values, standardization of country codes (NOC), and formatting of dates and event names for consistency. After preparation, the cleaned data was imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard with features such as drill-up/down, drill-through navigation, bookmarks, slicers, and custom DAX measures.

The dashboard allows users to explore:

Medal distribution by country, sport, and athlete.
Participation trends across different years and genders.
Geographical representation of host cities and participating nations.
Comparative analysis of countriesâ€™ performance over time.

This visualization provides clear, insightful, and interactive exploration of Olympic history, helping users identify patterns, dominant nations, and shifts in participation over more than a century.
